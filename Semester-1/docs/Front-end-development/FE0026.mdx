### What are replaced elements in CSS?

As per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Images_media_form_elements#replaced_elements), “Images and video are described as replaced elements. This means that CSS cannot affect the internal layout of these elements — only their position on the page amongst other elements.”

### Sizing Images

Everything in CSS generates a box. If you place an image inside a box that is smaller or larger than the intrinsic dimensions of the image file in either direction, it will either appear smaller than the box or overflow the box.
