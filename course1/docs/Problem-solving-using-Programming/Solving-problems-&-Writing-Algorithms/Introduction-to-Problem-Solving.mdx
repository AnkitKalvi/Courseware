# Efficient Problem Solving
## Objective
In this lesson we will be dealing with the structured way of approaching a Programming Question and solving it efficiently. We will learn about the various methodologies and techniques used to get the right approach towards solving a question by simply discussing a problem of getting the shortest path in the puzzle.

## Why should we solve a problem effeciently?
As we know that in today's world there are so many computer softwares that helps us in getting our task done in an instant of time. So have you ever imagined that if these programs that had made up the software were just based on brute force approach then what would have happened.Iâ€™ll tell you, if these programs were not made efficiently then our software might have taken years to complete the task which could be done within seconds.
