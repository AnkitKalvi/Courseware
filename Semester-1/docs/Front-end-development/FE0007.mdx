## What is involved in styling text in CSS?

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals) describes “If you have worked with HTML or CSS already, e.g., by working through these tutorials in order, then you know that text inside an element is laid out inside the element's content box. It starts at the top left of the content area (or the top right, in the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the line. Once it reaches the end, it goes down to the next line and flows to the end again. This pattern repeats until all the content has been placed in the box.”

Get ready for exploring all the different types of styling text in CSS.

By now we would have got a very good undertaking on “What is fundamental text and font styling”, let’s explore its types.

Here is an interesting [article by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-font-style-how-to-change-text-color-and-size-with-an-html-tag/) which will help you understand how to Change Text Color and Size with an HTML Tag.


## Fonts

Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website. The right font can create a strong identity for your brand. Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.
