# Thinking with Numbers - Part 1
## Objective
In this lesson, you will learn  how you should approach programming problems. We will try to understand the thinking process that is involved in approaching programming problems by building an analogy with numbers and observations related to numbers.
## Why to think with numbers?
You must understand that computers are basically naive devices that process data and convert it into the required results and they use the instructions provided by the programmer to do so. Basically, in the future when you will be using your programming skills to solve coding problems, you will find that to think of the logic to the problems, you will be trying to uncover patterns in the examples provided. And thatâ€™s one of the places you will be trying to think in numbers and number patterns.

Also, many times you will find pattern problems like these to check your logical thinking ability in preliminary tests that you will face for getting hired.
## Introduction to the Lesson
Today, we will be solving some number puzzles which will mainly test your skills of observation and pattern discovery.

This will be a fun and playful lesson and you will be guided through the thought process that is involved in solving these puzzles.You can find a plethora of such problems on various online platforms. We will be discussing 3 different formats for problems in this lesson and they are as follows:

1. MatchStick Magic
2. Number Series
3. KenKen Puzzles
