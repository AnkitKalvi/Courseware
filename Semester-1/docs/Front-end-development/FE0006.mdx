## What are your learning goals in this lesson?

Goal 1: To learn how we can apply CSS to HTML

Goal 2: Basic components of CSS


## Applying CSS to HTML

First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.

**External stylesheet :**

An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the** most common and useful method of bringing CSS** to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet.

**Internal stylesheet : **

An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a &lt;style> element contained inside the HTML &lt;head>.

In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with a content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files.But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a **less efficient way of working**.

**Inline styles :**

Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute.Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to** resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive**. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.


## Basic Components of CSS


### Selectors

A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. We have already discovered a variety of selectors in the Getting started with CSS tutorial. If CSS is not applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way you think it should match.

Each CSS rule starts with a selector or a list of selectors in order to tell the browser which element or elements the rules should apply to. \


**Specificity :**

The CSS language has rules to control which selector is stronger in the event of a conflict. These rules are called **cascade **and** specificity**.Later styles replace conflicting styles that appear earlier in the stylesheet. This is **the cascade rule**.

Sometimes, CSS might not apply as you expected because something else in the stylesheet has more specificity. Recognizing that more than one rule could apply to an element is the first step in fixing these kinds of issues.


### Properties and values

At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:

**Properties:** These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size, width, background-colour.

**Values:** Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.

When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are found within CSS Declaration Blocks. In the example below, highlighting identifies the CSS declaration block.Finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS rulesets (or CSS rules). Setting CSS properties to specific values is the primary way of defining layout and styling for a document. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page.

**CSS properties and values are case-insensitive**. The property and value in a property-value pair are separated by a colon (:).


### @rules

CSS @rules (pronounced "at-rules") provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave. Some @rules are simple with just a keyword and a value. For example, **@import** imports a stylesheet.Another common @rule that you are likely to encounter is **@media**, which is used to create media queries. Media queries use conditional logic for applying CSS styling.eet into another CSS stylesheet


### Shorthands

Some properties like font, background, padding, border, and margin are called shorthand properties. This is because shorthand properties set **several values in a single line**.


### Comments

As with any coding work, it is best practice to write comments along with CSS. This helps you to remember how the code works as you come back later for fixes or enhancement. It also helps others understand the code.CSS comments begin with /* and end with */. In the example below, comments mark the start of distinct sections of code. This helps to navigate the codebase as it gets larger. With this kind of commenting in place, searching for comments in your code editor becomes a way to **efficiently find a section of code.**


### White space

White space means actual spaces, tabs and new lines. Just as browsers ignore white space in HTML, **browsers ignore white space inside CSS**. The value of white space is how it can improve readability.
