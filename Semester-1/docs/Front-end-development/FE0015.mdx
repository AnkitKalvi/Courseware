### What are Conflicting Rules?


According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#conflicting_rules) “At some point, you will be working on a project and find that the CSS you thought should be applied to an element is not working. Often, the problem is that you create two rules that apply different values of the same property to the same element. Cascade and the closely-related concept of specificity are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict. The rule that's styling your element may not be the one you expect, so you need to understand how these mechanisms work.”


## Cascade


### What is Cascade?

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade), “The cascade is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different sources. The cascade defines the origin and layer that takes precedence when declarations in more than one origin or cascade layer set a value for a property on an element.”

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade), “There are three factors to consider, listed here in increasing order of importance. Later ones overrule earlier ones:”



1. **Source order** [covered in the 1st video of cascade]: If you have more than one rule, all of which have the same weight, then the one that comes last in the CSS will win.
2. **Importance**: This flag is used to make an individual property and value pair the most specific rule, thereby overriding the normal rules of the cascade, including normal inline styles. 


## Specificity 


### What is Specificity?

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) “Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element. The specificity algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations gets applied to an element.”


#### **How is specificity calculated?**

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#how_is_specificity_calculated),” Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration. The weight is determined by the number of selectors of each weight category in the selector matching the element (or pseudo-element). If there are two or more declarations providing different property values for the same element, the declared value in the style block having the matching selector with the greatest algorithmic weight gets applied.

The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or weights - ID, CLASS, and TYPE - corresponding to the three types of selectors. The value represents the count of selector components in each weight category and is written as ID - CLASS - TYPE. The three columns are created by counting the number of selector components for each selector weight category in the selectors that match the element.”


## Inheritance


### What is Inheritance?

GIF link: https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzI0NDMyMzQuZ2lm/original/o2RXqi.gif

Inheritance is associated with how the elements in the HTML markup inherit properties from their parent (containing) elements and pass them on to their children


### Understanding Inheritance

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#understanding_inheritance) “Inheritance in CSS occurs when an inheritable property is not set on an element. It goes up in its parent chain to set the property value to its parent value. CSS properties such as height, width, border, margin, padding, etc. are not inherited.”


### Controlling inheritance


#### **What is Controlling inheritance?**

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#controlling_inheritance) “CSS provides five special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS property accepts these values.

**Inherit** :

Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element. Effectively, this "turns on inheritance".

**Initial :**

Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.

**Revert :**

Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property.

**Revert Layer: **

Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a previous cascade layer.

**Unset :**

Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like the initial.”

**Resetting all property values :**

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#resetting_all_property_values), “The CSS shorthand property can be used to apply one of these inheritance values to (almost) all properties at once. Its value can be any one of the inheritance values (inherit, initial, revert, revert-layer, or unset). It's a convenient way to undo changes made to styles so that you can get back to a known starting point before beginning new changes”.


### Order of overriding declarations

Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order, with later ones overriding earlier ones: [Reference MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#order_of_overriding_declarations)



1. Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g. the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set).
2. Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).
3. Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us, the web developers).
4. Important declarations in author style sheets
5. Important declarations in user style sheets
6. Important declarations in user agent style sheets


## Organizing your CSS


#### Why do we need to organize css?

According to MDN, “As you start to work on larger stylesheets and big projects you will discover that maintaining a huge CSS file can be challenging. Organizing css is a  best practice for writing your CSS to make it easily maintainable, and some of the solutions you will find in use by others to help improve maintainability.”

**Learning unit: Specificity**

Find the specificity of the statments using the rule given below.

A selector’s specificity is calculated as follows:

i) count 1 if the declaration is from is a ‘style’ attribute rather than a rule with a selector, 0 otherwise (= a) (In HTML, values of an element’s “style” attribute are style sheet rules. These rules have no selectors, so a=1, b=0, c=0, and d=0.)

ii) count the number of ID attributes in the selector (= b)

iii) count the number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= c)

iv) count the number of element names and pseudo-elements in the selector (= d)

11. Find the specificity of this “*”.

    a. specificity = 0,0,0,0

    b. specificity = 0,0,0,1

    c. specificity = 0,0,1,0

Answer : a

12. Find the specificity of this ” ul li”.

    a. specificity = 0,0,0,0

    b. specificity = 0,0,1,2

    c. specificity = 0,0,0,2

    d. specificity = 2,0,0,0

Answer: c

13. Find the specificity of this “li:first-line”.

    a. specificity = 0,0,1,1

    c. specificity = 0,1,0,1

    d. specificity = 1,0,0,1

Answer: b

14. Find the specificity of this “ul ol li.red”.

    a. specificity = 0,0,3,1

    b. specificity = 0,0,1,3

    c. specificity = 1,1,1,1

    d. specificity = 1,2,2,1
