### What are Html Forms?

As per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form), “Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way.”
