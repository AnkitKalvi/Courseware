## Road map to complete this lesson

Milestone 1:  Learn about debugging in CSS and dev tools which help us debug CSS codes.

### What is Debugging in CSS?

As per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Debugging_CSS), “Sometimes when writing CSS you will encounter an issue where your CSS doesn't seem to be doing what you expect. Perhaps you believe that a certain selector should match an element, but nothing happens, or a box is a different size than you expected.”

  

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Debugging_CSS#how_to_access_browser_devtools) is a link which will help you learn how to access dev tools and the difference between DOM and View Source.

Using Dev tools we can inspect the CSS properties, edit values of different CSS properties and add a new CSS property as well.
