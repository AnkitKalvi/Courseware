Welcome to the lesson on Front-end web development. This would be a self-paced class that focuses primarily on the Values and Units  used in CSS.

  

Please make sure that you are completing the entire lesson.

## What are your learning goals in this lesson

Goal 1: Learning about CSS Values

Goal 2: Learning about sizing Items in CSS

## What is a CSS value?

As per  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#what_is_a_css_value), “Every CSS property has a value type that defines the values allowed for that property.”

  

Let's have a look at some of the types of values and units

### Numeric Value Type( Number, length and percentage)

There are various numeric value types that we find in CSS.

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#numbers_lengths_and_percentages) is a link which will help you understand the Numeric Value type better.

### Color

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#color) describes “There are many ways to specify color in CSS, some of which are more recently implemented than others. The same color values can be used everywhere in CSS, whether you are specifying text color, background color, or whatever else.”

  

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#color) is a link which will help you understand the Color better.

### Images

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#images) describes, “The `<image>` value type is used, wherever an image has a valid value. The image can be a linear gradient or an image pointed to by a URL( ) function.”

  

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#images) is a link which will help you understand the Images better.

### Position

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#position) describes, ”The `<position>` value type represents a set of 2D coordinates, used to position an item such as a background image (via background-position).”

  

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#position) is a link which will help you understand the position better.

### Strings and Identifiers

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#strings_and_identifiers) is a link which will help you understand the Strings and Identifiers better.

### Function

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#functions) describes, “In programming, a function is a reusable section of code that can be run multiple times to complete a repetitive task with minimum effort on the part of both the developer and the computer.”

  

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#functions) is a link which will help you understand the function better.

## Sizing items in CSS

As per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS), “In the various lessons so far, you have come across a number of ways to size items on a web page using CSS. Understanding how big the different features in your design will be is important. So in this lesson, we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms about sizing that will help you in the future.”

### The natural or intrinsic size of things

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS#the_natural_or_intrinsic_size_of_things) describes, “HTML Elements have a natural size, set before they are affected by any CSS. A straightforward example is an image. An image file contains sizing information, described as its intrinsic size. This size is determined by the image itself, not by any formatting we happen to apply.”

  

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS) is a link to understand sizing in CSS better.
